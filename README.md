A Tauri frontend of Czkawka, based on `czkawka_core`, targeting only macOS and Windows(It hasn't been tested in practice yet) platforms

I developed it because Czkawka on my computer started crashing upon opening after just a few uses. The UI/UX is actually referenced from Krokiet, and the functionality is also the same as Krokiet
